# 📈 E-commerce Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

## 1. 🎯 Project Overview & Business Problem

In today's competitive e-commerce landscape, understanding and catering to different customer groups is paramount for sustainable growth. A one-size-fits-all marketing approach is inefficient and often ineffective. This project addresses this challenge by implementing a data-driven customer segmentation strategy using the powerful **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model.

The primary goal is to move beyond generic marketing by identifying distinct customer personas based on their transaction history. By analyzing customer behavior, we can answer critical business questions:

* Who are our most valuable and loyal customers (**Champions**)?
* Which customers are at risk of churning and need re-engagement (**At Risk**)?
* Who are our new customers, and how can we nurture them into loyal ones?
* Which customers are **Lost** and likely not worth significant marketing investment?

This analysis provides actionable insights that enable the business to tailor marketing campaigns, personalize communication, improve customer retention, and ultimately, drive revenue growth.

## 4. ⚙️ Methodology: The RFM Model

The project is centered around the RFM model, a proven marketing analysis technique used to quantitatively evaluate customer value.

* **Recency (R):** How recently did a customer make a purchase? Customers who purchased recently are more likely to purchase again.
* **Frequency (F):** How often do they purchase? Customers who purchase frequently are more engaged and loyal.
* **Monetary (M):** How much do they spend? Customers who spend more are more valuable to the business.

The analysis follows these key steps:

1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning:**
    * The raw transactional data is loaded from the `online_retail_II.csv` file.
    * The `InvoiceDate` column is converted to a proper datetime format.
    * A `TotalAmount` feature is engineered by multiplying `Quantity` and `Price`.

2.  **RFM Value Calculation:**
    * For each unique `Customer ID`, the three RFM values are calculated:
        * **Recency:** The number of days between the customer's last purchase and the most recent date in the dataset.
        * **Frequency:** The total number of unique invoices associated with the customer.
        * **Monetary:** The total sum of `TotalAmount` for all of the customer's transactions.

3.  **Weighted RFM Scoring & Segmentation:**
    * Instead of simple quintiles, a weighted scoring system is used to generate a single, consolidated `RFM_Score`.
    * First, customers are ranked based on each individual RFM metric (R, F, and M).
    * These ranks are then normalized to a scale of 0-100 to ensure comparability.
    * A weighted formula is applied to calculate the final `RFM_Score`, giving the most importance to Monetary value:
        `RFM_Score = (0.15 * R_rank_norm) + (0.30 * F_rank_norm) + (0.55 * M_rank_norm)`
    * Based on this final score, customers are categorized into five distinct segments using `np.where`:
        * **Top Customers** (`Score >= 9000`)
        * **High Value Customers** (`Score >= 8000`)
        * **Mid Value Customers** (`Score >= 7000`)
        * **Low Value Customers** (`Score >= 6000`)
        * **Lost Customers** (`Score < 6000`)

4.  **Data Export:** The final processed DataFrame, containing each `Customer ID` along with their RFM values and assigned `CustomerID_Segment`, is exported to `rfm_for_powerbi.csv` for visualization.

## 5. 💡 Actionable Insights & Recommendations

The analysis and dashboard reveal several key insights that can inform business strategy:

* **Insight 1: The Pareto Principle in Action.** A significant portion of revenue is generated by "Top Customers" and "High Value Customers," even though they may represent a smaller fraction of the total customer base.
    * **Recommendation:** Implement a loyalty program with exclusive perks for these segments to increase retention and lifetime value. Acknowledge their loyalty with personalized thank-you notes or early access to new products.

* **Insight 2: The "Lost" Customer Dilemma.** The "Lost Customers" segment is the largest by customer count but contributes the least to revenue.
    * **Recommendation:** Avoid spending significant marketing budget on this group. Instead, a low-cost, automated "win-back" email campaign could be attempted. If there is no response, they can be excluded from future marketing pushes.

* **Insight 3: The Growth Opportunity.** The "Mid Value Customers" represent a crucial group with potential to become high-value.
    * **Recommendation:** Target this segment with promotions and product recommendations based on their purchase history to increase their purchase frequency and monetary value.

## 6. 🛠️ How to Replicate the Project

To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyterlab
    ```

4.  **Download the Dataset:**
    * Download the dataset from Kaggle: [Online Retail II UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci)
    * Unzip the file and place `online_retail_II.csv` in the root directory of the project.

5.  **Run the Analysis Notebook:**
    * Launch Jupyter Lab: `jupyter lab`
    * Open the `RFM_Analysis.ipynb` notebook and run all cells. This will generate the `rfm_for_powerbi.csv` file.

6.  **View the Power BI Dashboard:**
    * Open the `.pbix` file (Power BI file) using Power BI Desktop.
    * If prompted about a broken data source, go to **Transform data** -> **Data source settings**. Select the source and click **"Change Source..."**. Browse to the `rfm_for_powerbi.csv` file you generated in the previous step.
